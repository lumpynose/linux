// add the following to /etc/network/interfaces
allow-hotplug wlp2s0
iface wlp2s0 inet dhcp
    wpa-ssid "The Pulsating Inconvenience"
    wpa-psk secret

// after the following use the clear text password which is commented out
$ sudo wpa_passphrase "The Pulsating Inconvenience" secret > /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

// $ sudo apt install dhcpcd5
// $ sudo systemctl enable dhcpcd.service

// I already had wpa_supplicant running for a hardwired network
// but I don't understand how it was working without dhcp set up
// as per the above two lines.
// $ sudo systemctl restart wpa_supplicant
